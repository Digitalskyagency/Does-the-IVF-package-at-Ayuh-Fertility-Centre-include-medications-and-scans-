Yes, the IVF package at Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad is designed to be comprehensive and patient-friendly. It typically includes essential components such as consultations, follicular monitoring (ultrasound scans), hormonal injections, egg retrieval, fertilization (IVF or ICSI), and embryo transfer. However, depending on the specific case, some medications or tests might be charged separately if they fall outside the standard protocol. The clinic prioritizes transparency and ensures that patients are fully aware of whatâ€™s included in the treatment cost from the beginning. This reduces stress and builds trust with the care team. If additional procedures such as embryo freezing, donor gametes, or advanced lab techniques are needed, these are discussed with the patient beforehand. The goal at Ayuh is to provide high success rates while keeping the process affordable and understandable. For a personalized consultation and clear cost estimate, connect with Ayuh Fertility Centre.
